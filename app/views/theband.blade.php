                            <h3>Patrick Shea</h3>
                            <p>Lead Vocals/Keyboard</p>
                            <p>Pat started playing on a beat-up old classical guitar with steel strings just before
                                he started high school and it wasn’t long before he discovered he had an inherent love for
                                playing instruments.  He has played guitar and bass in both cover bands and originals but
                                he always found himself singing for the projects he was in.

                                With the birth of Pulse, it was decided that the only way to make the music truly
                                sound right was to integrate a keyboard and Pat is always up for learning a new instrument.
                                Having never learned to play, he started with the songs on Pulse’s set and took to it right away.
                                He may be new to the keyboard but his real contribution is in the way of vocals that can cut through
                                with piercing high notes or slide along a low, slow groove.  Pat is one part of four that make Pulse
                                such a unique and power sound.
